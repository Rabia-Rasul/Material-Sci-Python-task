# Material-Sci-Python-task
Material Science + Python Taks

Here is a short Python + Materials Science task for candidates interested in joining the D2R2 group. With basic knowledge in Python and Materials Science this should be achievable in about 1 hour.

**Getting Started**
Download this repository.
Use the template.py file to write your Python code in.

**Task A (Python and Databases)** 
Download the following database: DOI
Move the file WF-CE_database_58332.json into the repository folder.
Write Python code to plot the distribution of column cleavage_energy (save the created plot as a png or pdf file).
Are the columns WF and Fermi correlated? Write code to assess their correlation.

**Task B (Materials Informatics)**
Install pymatgen.
Write a function that takes any pymatgen Structure object and returns the unit cell volume, number of unique chemical elements, and the angle between lattice vectors a and b.
Get the crystal structure mp-2490 from the Materials Project.
Load that structure with pymatgen.
Test the function from step 2 with the loaded structure.
